I'm an SDE II at Amazon working on catalog indexing for [Amazon's third-party seller listing platform](https://sell.amazon.com/tools/seller-central). I work daily with distributed systems and streaming data processing. I enjoy making time to contribute to the [open-source projects](https://github.com/camerondurham/open-source-contributions) I use.
