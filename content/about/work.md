I went to USC in Los Angeles for my undergrad degree in computer science and
graduated in May 2021. Before that, I was an intern at Tesla working on
building remote simulations of the Model SX and 3Y infotainment UI builds (kind
of like Vercel for the vehicle infotainment system). Before that, I was an
intern at Amazon and Oracle.
