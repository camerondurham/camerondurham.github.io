I graduated from the University of Southern California in 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science. As a student, I served as Lead Course Producer for USC's Data Structures and Algorithms course. I also completed internships at Tesla, where I worked closely with Media UI, Test Automation, and Technical Writing teams to automate working to virtualize Model S/X, 3/Y infotainment user interfaces and at Amazon developing automated tools to automate customer support workflows.
