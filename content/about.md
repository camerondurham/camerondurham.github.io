I'm currently an SDE I at Amazon working on catalog indexing for Amazon's listing platform.

I went to USC in Los Angeles for my undergrad degree in computer science and
graduated in May 2021. Before that, I was an intern at Tesla working on building
remotely runnable infotainment UI builds (kind of like Vercel but for the vehicle
infotainment system). Before that, I was an intern at Amazon and Oracle.
