I'm an SDE I at Amazon working on catalog indexing for Amazon's third-party
seller listing platform.

I like distributed systems and virtualization. I went to USC in Los Angeles for
my undergrad degree in computer science and graduated in May 2021. Before that,
I was an intern at Tesla working on building remote simulations of the Model SX
and 3Y infotainment UI builds (kind of like Vercel for the vehicle infotainment
system). Before that, I was an intern at Amazon and Oracle.

In my spare time, I try to stay active and work on little 
[open-source projects](https://github.com/camerondurham).
I play a few games with friends like Fortnite, Apex, and also Cyberpunk 2077,
Valheim, and Satisfactory.
