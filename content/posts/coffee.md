| Press                  | Bloom Light Roast              | 2025-03-30   | Fruity, light roast. So far my favorite.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ![](/posts/press-bloom.png)                     |
| Peixoto                | Brazil Familia Peixoto         | 2025-03-30   | Medium roast, may be light but can't tell. Maybe has some fruitiness but mostly nut / more bitter taste. Packaging is superior and will keep longer. Ended up too dark roast for my personal taste, did have nutty/chocolate hints but I didn't taste berries like it's claimed. Had to drive out to Chandler to pick this up and didn't feel as worth it. | ![](/posts/peixoto.png)  |
| Cartel                 | El Salvador Miramar            | 2025-04-19   | Light Roast "Washed" Package notes say it tastes like Apple Galette, Walnut, White Grape. Bags of coffee come with a drip or cold brew if you pickup the bag in the store. The coffee is probably my new favorite after Press's light roast. It smelled amazing and has my favorite packaging.                                                             | ![](/posts/cartel.png) |
| Cult                   | Colombian Dream                | 2025-05-03   | Says it's a fruity balanced light roast. However it tastes slightly burnt, nutty I suppose and doesn't seem to have any notes of fruit. The cheapest option so far at ~$11 at Fry's.                                                                                                                                                                       | ![](/posts/cult.png)                            |
| Trader Joe's           | Whole Bean Coffee Medium Roast | 2025-05-18   | By far my least favorite coffee bean. It's so dark for a "medium roast" it seems like it's meant only to be consumed with lots of milk and sugar. Not very enjoyable for me. Still so far the cheapest option (I think it was ~$8 at Trader Joe's)                                                                                                         | ![](/posts/tj.png)                        |
| Counter Culture Coffee | Apollo - Coffee from Ethiopia  | 2025-05-18   | Nice light roast from Counter Culture with fruity/citrus taste and smells great. On discount for ~$13.40 at Whole Foods with even more discount for Prime members. It's light, really nice to taste.                                                                                                                                                       | ![](/posts/counter-culture.png)                          |
| Roastery of Cave Creek | Cowgirl - Lighter Roast        | 2025-06-02   | Good light roast, somewhat fruity and notes of berries. Relatively cheap as coffee beans got at ~$12 from Whole Foods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ![](/posts/roc2.png)                                    |
