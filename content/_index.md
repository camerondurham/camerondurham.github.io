I'm an SDE II at Amazon, working on catalog indexing for the third-party seller listing platform. I contributed to the [Amazon Haul](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/affordable-products-amazon-20-dollars-and-under) listing experience and work with streaming data processing for distributed search indexing. I also contribute to [open-source projects](https://github.com/camerondurham/open-source-contributions) I use.

Previously, I was a lead course producer for [USC's CS104 class](https://bytes.usc.edu/cs104/), developing [containerized tools](https://github.com/csci104/docker) for the class environment. I interned at Tesla, where I worked on containerized infotainment UIs for all Tesla car models. Before Tesla, I had internships at Amazon and Oracle.
