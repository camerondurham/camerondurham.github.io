## Improvements

### 2: Performance Software Upgrade

## Issues

Service issues documented for 2022 Polestar 2 (Performance + Pilot Package).

### Issue 1: Front Suspension Noise/Wobble
- **Symptoms:** Knocking/wobble sounds from front wheels at 50+ mph, similar to unbalanced tires
- **Potential Cause:** Foam insulation pad between wheel and tire causing uneven mass distribution
- **Evidence:** [Highway noise video](https://youtu.be/GY7blfG6En8) | [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polestar/comments/1anfxk8/fyi_if_you_get_a_tire_wobble/)
- **Status:** Fixed (2025-08-02)
- **Resolution:** Upgrade from incorrect, unbalanced tires put on by used car dealer (Bill Luke Chrysler Dodge in Phoenix) and/or previous owner to Continental Control Contact Sport STS+ 245/40 R20. New tires are very quiet and much higher quality.
